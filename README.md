## Project proposal:
<h1><b>Workout Tracker</b></h1>
Our application is going to be a personal workout tracker. You will be able to create your own personal workout schedule and: 
<ul>
<li>choose from a list of exercises</li>
<li>create and add your own exercuses</li>
<li>adjust the reps, sets, and weight of each exercise</li>
<li>start and end a current personal workout</li>
</ul>
When you start a personal workout it will track the length of the workout and note the date. Users will be people who go to the gym and want to keep track of their progess. This project is of interest to us both as we workout and are passionate about our health and fitness levels.
