## Project proposal:
<h1><b><i>Workout Tracker</i></b></h1>
Our application is going to be a personal workout tracker. You will be able to create your own personal workout schedule and:
<ul>
<li>choose from a list of exercises</li>
<li>create and add your own exercises</li>
<li>adjust the reps, sets, and weight of each exercise</li>
<li>start and end a current personal workout</li>
</ul>
When you start a personal workout it will track the length of the workout and note the date. There will be a history log that keeps track of all your previous saved workouts.
<br></br>
<h2>Who will use it?</h2>
Users will be people who go to the gym and want to keep track of their progess. 
<br></br>
<h2>Why are we interested in this project?</h2>
This project is of interest to us both as we workout and are passionate about our health and fitness levels.
